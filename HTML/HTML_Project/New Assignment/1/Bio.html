        Hello! My name is DhruvOzha. I am currently learning HTML 
        <b>from scratch</b> and really enjoying the process. 
        This is my very first <i>practice project</i> where I am 
        experimenting with <u>basic HTML tags</u>.
    </p>

    <p>
        My hobbies include <i>reading books</i>, <u>playing games</u>, 
        and <mark>exploring new technologies</mark>. <br>
        I also love solving small coding challenges to sharpen my skills. 
        Sometimes I even spend hours watching tech tutorials 
        just for <b>fun</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of my biggest goals is to become a 
        <b>full-stack developer</b> in the next <mark>2 years</mark>. <br>
        I also want to contribute to <i>open-source projects</i> and 
        help beginners like me. <br><br>
        Fun fact: I dream of creating my own website 
        where I will teach coding concepts like 
        H<sub>2</sub>O for chemistry lovers or E = mc<sup>2</sup> 
        for physics fans!
