    <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>

    <p>
        The story of <b>computers</b> and the <b>Internet</b> is a tale of 
        <i>innovation</i>, <u>persistence</u>, and <strong>global impact</strong>. 
        From early calculating devices to modern <em>artificial intelligence</em> systems, 
        technology has reshaped how we work, communicate, and live. 
        This article explores the <mark>milestones</mark> in the development of computers 
        and the birth of the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>.

    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The history of computers began with simple <b>mechanical devices</b> like the 
        <i>abacus</i>. In the 19th century, Charles Babbage designed the 
        <u>Analytical Engine</u>, which many consider the <strong>first programmable computer</strong>. 
        His collaborator, <em>Ada Lovelace</em>, is recognized as the world's first computer programmer. 
        Unlike today's machines, these early inventions used gears and levers instead of 
        <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> chips. 
        The evolution from mechanical to electronic systems marked a <mark>revolutionary shift</mark> 
        in human history.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>first generation</strong> of computers (1940s-1950s) relied on 
        <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, which were bulky and prone to failure. 
        The <i>second generation</i> introduced <u>transistors</u>, making machines 
        smaller and more reliable. The <em>third generation</em> adopted integrated circuits, 
        while the <b>fourth generation</b> brought in microprocessors, transforming 
        computers into <small>personal devices</small>. 
        The <del>fifth generation</del> is still a vision in progress, often associated 
        with <ins>artificial intelligence</ins>.  
        Over time, <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> and <abbr title="Read Only Memory">ROM</abbr> 
        have become essential components for processing and storage.
    </p>

    <p>
        Computers also play a role in mathematics and science.  
        A famous formula from physics: E = mc<sup>2</sup>.  
        In chemistry: H<sub>2</sub>O represents water.  
        In algorithms, we may use variables like <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> to compute 
        <code>sum = x + y</code>.  
    </p>

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
        The Internet's origins trace back to <strong>ARPANET</strong> in the late 1960s.  
        It was designed as a military project but soon expanded to research and universities.  
        By the 1990s, the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> created by 
        <em>Tim Berners-Lee</em> made the Internet accessible to the public.  
        The <u>web browser</u> became a key tool, transforming computers into 
        <mark>communication hubs</mark>.  
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <q>The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.</q>  
        - <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
        In today's world, we no longer depend on <del>dial-up connections</del> but instead use 
        <ins>fiber optics</ins>, <ins>broadband</ins>, and wireless technology.  
        Computers have evolved from room-sized machines to <small>smartphones</small> 
        that fit into our pockets. The Internet now powers <b>cloud computing</b>, 
        <em>social networks</em>, and <u>online education</u>.  
        With <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, computers can now understand 
        <mark>natural language</mark>, recognize images, and even drive cars.  
        Despite rapid progress, ethical issues remain a significant concern.

    <h2>Computer Example</h2>
    <p>Here is a simple HTML code snippet:</p>
    <pre>
<code>
<html>
  <body>
    <p>Hello World</p>
  </body>
</html>
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        To copy this code, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> on your keyboard.  
        System response: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The journey from <i>mechanical calculators</i> to the <strong>Internet of Things</strong> 
        illustrates humanity's <em>unending quest</em> for progress.  
        As technology continues to evolve, society must ensure that advancements remain 
        inclusive, ethical, and beneficial for all.  
        Computers and the Internet have truly become the <u>backbone</u> of the modern era, 
        shaping the way we live, learn, and connect across the globe.
